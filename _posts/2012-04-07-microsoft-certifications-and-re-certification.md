With the launch of SQL Server 2012 I decided to check the [Microsoft Learning](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/default.aspx "Microsoft Learning") site to find out when the exams will be available.  It seems that the new [SQL Server 2012 professional certifications](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-sql-server.aspx#tab2 "Explore the SQL Server 2012 Certifications") (MCITP) have been reduced to two, one for the Data Platform and another for Business Intelligence. This does make sense since any SQL Server professional carrying out Database Administration or Business Intelligence duties should technically have a degree of knowledge in Database Development; from advanced T-SQL skills to programming using a .NET language to understand and develop CLR code modules.  The Microsoft Learning site states that exams will be available from June 2012.  Each certification will require that candidates pass five exams with the 70-461, 70-462, and 70-463 exams being common for both certifications.  The candidate can then choose to sit for the 70-464 and 70-465 exams which leads to the Data Platform certification or 70-466 and 70-467 exams to achieve the Business Intelligence certification.  The list of exam titles to date is reproduced below:

### Data Platform ###

* Exam 70-461: Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012
* Exam 70-462: Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases
* Exam 70-463: Implementing a Data Warehouse with Microsoft SQL Server 2012
* Exam 70-464: Developing Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases
* Exam 70-465: Designing Database Solutions for Microsoft SQL Server 2012

### Business Intelligence ###

* Exam 70-461: Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012
* Exam 70-462: Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases
* Exam 70-463: Implementing a Data Warehouse with Microsoft SQL Server 2012
* Exam 70-466: Implementing Data Models and Reports with Microsoft SQL Server 2012
* Exam 70-467: Designing Business Intelligence Solutions with Microsoft SQL Server 2012

Another change relates to the [re-certification policy](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/exam-prep.aspx#tab4 "Microsoft Certification Exam Policies").  The new SQL Server 2012 professional certifications apparently have an "expiry" date of three years, which Microsoft define as when the certification will become Inactive.  The reason behind this change in policy is to ensure _"that Microsoft Certifications remain meaningful and valuable indicators of candidates’ skills"_.  This might make achieving certifications more of a challenge since candidates will have to "prove themselves" every three years instead of with every new version of SQL Server.  On the positive side, the achieved certification will **not** be bound to a particular version of product, so the certification update will be proof that the candidate's skills are current.  Another aspect that Microsoft are also looking into the introduction of _continuing education credits_ instead of recertification exams.  This might be easier for candidates who have already achieved a professional certification and do not or cannot study all the course material.

Microsoft's reasoning might be correct since they (Microsoft) want to ensure that employers are getting the best candidates when looking to employ SQL Server professionals. On the other hand I might be wrong and this might be the better option.  Only time will tell.  In the meantime course material is being updated and book authors are probably working furiously on books that will cover the subject.
