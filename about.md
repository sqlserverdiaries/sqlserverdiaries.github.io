Thank you for visiting.

I started off my career in I.T. in July 1998 as a junior programmer using Borland Delphi and Interbase. I then changed employer in March and again in May 2000 to a programming/developer role primarily using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, 7, and 2000. Started working with SQL Server 2005, got my first MCTS certification and migrated some production databases from Informix. In the meantime I also migrated and configured a BI solution from BusinessObjects 5 to BusinessObjects XI R2. Changed role in August 2007 to that of an SQL Server DBA within the same company, read a lot, and managed to achieve a couple of certifications. I regularly read books, magazines, white papers, blog articles and more, trying frantically to catch up with the advances in the technology. I am also certified as an MCITP: Database Administrator (for SQL Server 2005), an MCITP: Database Administrator 2008, as well as an MCTS: SQL Server 2008, Database Development . I plan to continue increasing my knowledge of SQL Server, with the possibility of working toward getting certified as an MCM and later as an MCA, some dayâ€¦
