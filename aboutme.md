Thank you for visiting.

My career in I.T. started in July 1998, working as a Junior Programmer using Borland Delphi and Interbase. 

In March, then again in May 2000, I switched employer to a Programming/Developer role primarily using Microsoft Visual Basic 6 and Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, 7, and 2000.

Later on I started working with SQL Server 2005, got my first MCTS certification and migrated a few production databases from Informix.  In the meantime I also migrated and configured a BI solution from BusinessObjects 5 to BusinessObjects XI R2.

In August 2007 I move to a SQL Server DBA role within the same organisation, read a lot, and managed to achieve a couple of certifications.

I regularly read books, magazines, white papers, blog articles and more, trying frantically to catch up with the advances in the technology. I am also certified as an MCITP: Database Administrator (for SQL Server 2005), an MCITP: Database Administrator 2008, as well as an MCTS: SQL Server 2008, Database Development.

Future plans include continuing to further my knowledge of SQL Server, with the possibility of working toward getting certified as an MCM and later as an MCA, some dayâ€¦ (EDIT: Microsoft have discontinued the latter certifications).
